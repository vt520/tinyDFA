# An Introduction to tinyDFA

## Overview

tinyDFA is a collection of Macros, Templates, and Classes that allow for easily modeling or augmenting an arduino project using state machines as a first-class construction.  [States](./class/State.md) are presented as [discrete units](./structure/state.md) that receive a (process) [Context](./class/Context.md) using [events](./structure/state.md#events) that roughly correspond to the lifetime of a simple task (Enter, Execute, Exit).  States are then [Executed](./class/Process.md#execute) by a [Process](./class/Process.md)
